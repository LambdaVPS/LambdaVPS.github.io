We will be live in less than a week! Currently, we are getting payment processing set up with Stripe (through Virtkick), and once that's done you will be able to order. We strive to be the best provider possible for the price you pay (~&frac12; DigitalOcean's), and so, to celebrate our launch, we will **take off $1/GB RAM/mo** for
new subscribers in December 2015! Your discount will last as long as the machine you create in December exists.

Price table with discount:

|1GB RAM|2GB RAM|4GB RAM|8GB RAM|
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|$5/mo  |$10/mo |$20/mo |$40/mo |

# Current issues

 - Payment processing is not currently set up.
 - We are currently having a bit of a shortage of IPv4 addresses, although we are working to get this resolved.
